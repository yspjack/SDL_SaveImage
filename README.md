# SDL_SaveImage
Convert SDL_Surface into images(jpeg,bmp,png,...)
For SDL 1.x only. This program is currently NOT compatible with SDL 2.0 or newer version.

Since I'm a student now, I'll add the files VERY SLOWLY. Sorry.

# Current
- [x] jpg
- [x] png(RGB only)

# TODO
Add png support(full)

Add bmp support

optimize memory use & performance

Add webp support
